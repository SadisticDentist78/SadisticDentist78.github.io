        Hello. This is Arsalan and I am a 21 year old international student.
        I am from Russia, to be precise from a city called Ulan-Ude,
        it's a relatively small city of roughly 400 thousand people famous for having biggest <i>statue of Lenin's head</i>,
        and it is the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, one of Russia's many regions.
        I came to Canada to pursue education and become a quality specialist.</p>

        I haw a few hobbies, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Playing video games. Right now I am playing mostly Dead by Daylight and Rebel Inc.</li>
            <li>Walking, but only when it's not hot. I hate summer.</li>
            <li>Listenning Music. Classical hits me the most.</li>
        </ul>
 
        <p>
        Prior to the Interactive Media Design program, I was studying Game Development, also in Algonquin College.
        I studied for 4 terms, and the decision to change my program wasn't an easy one. I hated leaving the program this late,
        and I had a fight with my mother, but ultimately I couldn't be a game developer, this wasn't my profession.
        The last thing I want to do with my life is to something I dislike every single day.
        </p>

        I must admit though that I am also naturally prone to overconfidence leading to procrastination.
        I sometimes feel the task is so easy to do that I just end up leaving it for later. Even this assignment,
        I am doing it at 5 am of June 10<sup>th</sup>, 2022. This overconfidence was one of the reasons I failed
        my Game Development program, I just kept postponing things thinking they are so easy. Hence, I want to end my
        introducton with a quote from one of my favorite games and pledge to work harder:
        </p>
